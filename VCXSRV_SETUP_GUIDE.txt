VcXsrv Installation Guide
========================

VcXsrv is required to display GUI applications from Docker containers on Windows.

Step 1: Download VcXsrv
-----------------------
Go to: https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/
Click "Download" and save the installer.

Step 2: Install VcXsrv
----------------------
1. Run the downloaded installer
2. Follow the installation wizard
3. Accept default settings

Step 3: Configure XLaunch
-------------------------
1. Start "XLaunch" from the Start Menu
2. Display settings: Choose "Multiple windows"
3. Session type: Choose "Start no client"
4. Extra settings: 
   - CHECK "Disable access control"
   - CHECK "Native opengl" (optional)
5. Click "Next" then "Finish"

Step 4: Allow through Firewall
------------------------------
When Windows Firewall asks:
- Allow VcXsrv on both Private and Public networks

Step 5: Verify VcXsrv is Running
--------------------------------
- Look for VcXsrv icon in system tray (bottom-right corner)
- The icon should be visible when running

Step 6: Test Docker GUI

If GUI doesn't appear:

4. Run docker-test.bat to isolate issues

For help, the application debug output will show any connection errors.
